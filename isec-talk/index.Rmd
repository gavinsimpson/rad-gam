# Modelling failure

RADs & SADs have been tortured to death with all manner or mechanistic and deterministic models

* Fisher's log-series fit to abundances
* Preston's log-normal fit (to binned abundances)
* MacArthur's broken stick model
* &hellip;

Some are statistical, some mechanistic, and all fit some data sets well and others poorly

Data don't contain enough information to distinguish between models

Arguably a failure

# Recent interest

Continued interest because RAD is such a fundamental descriptor

Focus has shifted to how have RADs changed over time

# Modelling the RAD

Rank clocks don't lend themselves to identify when and how RADs have changed

Avolio et al's metrics are one or more steps removed from the RAD (propagation of uncertainty)

--

Instead, I propose that we model the RAD itself

Rather than force a particular shape or mechanism, do this phenomenologically

Let the data determine the shape of the RAD

---

# From my abstract

> I will briefly describe the proposed approach and demonstrate its use with examples from a long-term nutrient enrichment experiment, a spatial survey from a serpentine grassland, and a time series of a desert rodent community.

As part of what Ben called the GAM Mafia, of course I have to do this as a GAM

# Generalized additive models

Linear predictor of strictly parametric terms plus a sum of smooth, arbitrary functions of covariates

Splines are built up from basis functions

Here I'm showing a cubic regression spline basis with 10 knots/functions

We weight each basis function to get a spline. Here all the basis functions have the same weight so they would fit a horizontal line

# Weight basis functions &#8680; spline

```{r basis-function-animation, results = 'hide'}
bfun_plt <- plot(bfuns) +
    geom_line(data = smooth, aes(x = x, y = spline),
              inherit.aes = FALSE, lwd = 1.5) +
    labs(x = 'x', y = 'f(x)') +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 14, base_family = 'Fira Sans')

bfun_anim <- animate(
    bfun_plt + transition_states(draw, transition_length = 4, state_length = 2) +
        ease_aes("cubic-in-out"),
    nframes = 200, height = anim_height, width = anim_width, res = anim_res,
    dev = anim_dev, units = "px")

anim_save('resources/basis-fun-anim.gif', bfun_anim)
```

But if we choose different weights we get more wiggly spline

Each of the splines I showed you earlier are all generated from the same basis functions just using different weights

Fitting a GAM involves finding the weights for the basis functions that produce a spline that fits the data best, subject to some constraints

# Models

Treat the RAD as a histogram and smooth it &mdash; rich history

How to model the change in RADs over samples?

1. Treat each RAD as a subject & smooth them pooling over subjects
    * `s(rank) + s(rank, depth, bs = "fs")`
2. Treat each RAD as a subject & smooth them shrinking temporal neighbours
    * `s(rank) + s(rank, bs = "mrf", xt = list(depth_pen))`
3. Use a tensor product and assume RAD smooth varies smoothly over time
    * `s(rank) + te(rank, depth)`

# Problems

* RADs are monotonic, strictly non-increasing &mdash; the smooths aren't
    * Data help, but using GAM machinery could violate this
* Can fit shape-constrained splines which force montonicity
    * *scam* ðŸ“¦ smooths can't be combined in tensor products
    * Can't mix constrained smooth for the RAD with unconstrained smooth for change in RAD over time, space
    * Super slow, even for modest data sets
    * P spline world might have some options (Marx & Eilers)
* Could also switch to modelling the SAD but convert model fits into RAD format (e.g. Alroy, 2024 _EcoEvoRxiv_)

---

# Future work

* Respect the monotonicity constraint on the RAD

* Use the model to derive some of the things ecologists care about (sense Avolio _et al_)

    * Derivative of estimated RAD could be used for change in eveness

* &hellip; more
